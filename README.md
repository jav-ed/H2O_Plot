Hydrogen Density-Pressure-Temperature Plot
The following plot provides an interactive view that allows exploration of the relationship between hydrogen's density, pressure, and temperature. You can use the legend to selectively hide or show the desired H2 plot

## Infos about hydrogen density accuaracy
1) [220; 1000] K = [-53; 727]°C and p [0;70] MPa with 0.01%
2) [255; 1000] K = [-18; 727]°C and p [0;120] MPa with 0.01%
3) [200; 1000] K = [-73; 727]°C and p [0;200] MPa with 0.1%



# How to install
1) Make sure to have Python installed, we tested it with python v. 3.10.6
2) From here on two possibilties
   1) open terminal an write: 
    'git clone https://github.com/jav-ed/H2O_Plot.git'
   1) or download it directly though the GUI provided by Github (Click on Code and then on Download Zip)
